    description= _ "In a land of honourable fighting, where the strength of armies is mostly measured by their bravery and strength, the Dune Assassin are known for their ability to quickly dispatch a person with the speed of a lightning bolt. Their proficiency in assassinating their targets makes sure only people employing them for mischievous deeds even have a hunch of their excellent techniques. This only serves to increase the horror common soldiers feel at the prospect of facing a Quismat one day."
