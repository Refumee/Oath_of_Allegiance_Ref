    description= _ "For many races, it is highly unlikely to send their females into battle. For certain elvish populations however, females called 'bloodmaiden' are sent into battle as a rearguard whenever the elvish army suffered huge losses. Only equipped with a long skirt and a sharp sword, the bloodmaidens then blindly search for the ones that harmed their kin, finding them and turning the battlefield into a pool of blood."
