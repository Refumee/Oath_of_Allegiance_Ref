    description= _ "Once being an adventurous elf roaming the desert lands in the search of so called moon crystals, Au'la encountered the Sphere, the magical construct of the Athvari, when it wrested free from their hands. The Sphere served as an arcane prison that prohibits the use of magic of the imprisoned ones. Yet the three great mages that had been locked inside its dimensions had been able to overcome the magical barriers and cast forth their desastrous magic from inside. During the direct encounter with the Sphere, harmful magic known to destroy life with ease had been casted from within. Au'la, however, was not influenced by it. Instead, the magic set free her inner magical powers and turned into a pure magical being. It is said, that the moon crystals protected her from the harmful magic. Being a transcended form, swords and pikes can't harm her and she can even absorb the life power of her enemies. While she is not an inherently evil creatuer, her foes fear her, because she can make the bodies of her enemies implode with raw force."
