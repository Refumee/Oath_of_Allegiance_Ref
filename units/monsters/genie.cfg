    description= _ "Genie are magical beings that inhabited the great deserts even before men arrived. They are innate friendly beings that maintain a good relationship with humans. Genie helped the people of the desert to build their enormous cities. When the Three Kings of K'thar abused the powers of magic, most genie died, since they are susceptible to destructive magic. Only a few have found a safe place - either in manmade objects, such as lamps, swords or jewelry, or in men that agreed to host a genie in their mortal body. United they form the mighty half-genie that are both man and genie. In the land of the deserts, half-genies are not seen as bastards, in fact, they are respected throughout the lands, as their union symbolises the great bond between man and genie that brought forth many good things to the life of both kin. Genie hate Afariyaten more than anything else."
