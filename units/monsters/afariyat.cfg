    description= _ "Afariyaten are hexed djinns that inhabit the depths below the sand and as such, they seemingly emerge from dust and sands. Most weapons can't harm them, yet there were not many encounters at which the foe of the afariyat survived, as afariyaten are able to petrify their enemy with a simple touch. They hate djinn by heart."
