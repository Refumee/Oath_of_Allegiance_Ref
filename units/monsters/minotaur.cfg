    description= _ "Minotaurs have the statue of both man and bull and are often found in the eastern parts of the mountainside around Kesh and the eastern flatlands. These strong creatures are occasionally caught and trained for war, but oftentimes catching a minotaur leads to the death of numerous soldiers and hunters, resulting in a loss of valuable manpower to rival the beasts own worth. Thus, the decision to field these unstable creatures is not a matter to be taken lightly and better be thought through thrice."
